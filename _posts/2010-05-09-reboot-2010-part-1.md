I finally got around to my annual spring cleaning and decided to kick it off
with a redesign of this website.  The old site was managed using the [Drupal][1] 
content management system and I never really did much with it.  I have come to 
the realization that the reason I never did much with Drupal may be that it 
was the wrong tool for the job.  Drupal was designed to provide services such 
as blogging to a *community* of people-- and by myself I don't constitute 
a community by any definition.  Simply put, Drupal was an overkill solution 
for managing a personal site.

I pondered other blogging platforms such as [Wordpress][2] and [Posterous][3].
Posterous is interesting in that it allows you to publish content simply by
emailing a post to their website.  However, in the end I decided that using some
sort of blogging platform to manage my website was again overkill.

Blogging is not something I really expect to do with this site-- I can hardly
keep a journal!  What I do want to do with this site is record interesting
tidbits of information or recipes for completing certain tasks for future
reference by myself and others.  I would also like a spot to publish some of my
work so that others can find it.

In the end, [this post][4] by Tom Preston-Werner, one of the co-founders of
GitHub, convinced me to try using [Jekyll][5] to manage my site.  Jekyll is a
program, written in Ruby, that compiles a set of folders containing content into
a static website.

A blog compiler!  Now someone is speaking my language.

The best part is that I don't have to learn any new tools.  I don't have to
spend two evenings figuring out what all the buttons on the WordPress or
Posterous control panels do.  I just fire up my text editor, write down the
things I want to record, and then recompile my website.  I can also track
changes to posts using a version control system like git which fits more with my
vision of this site as a place to store persistent documents like how-tos.

At some point I plan to write a piece describing how I set up Jekyll to run on
my [Webfaction][6] hosted website such that it automatically refreshes every
time I push new changes to my [GitHub][7] repository.

Stay tuned!
