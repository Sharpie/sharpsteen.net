Apparently my desire to write blog posts has a recurrence interval of 4 years.

While cleaning out one of my old servers, I came across this blog.
It looked sad and lonely, so I decided to give it a new coat of paint.
This website is sill generated by the [Jekyll][jekyll] static site generator, but now the content is all dressed in a theme that is much better than the unfinished work I had applied to the last incarnation.
The new theme is named [Lanyon][lanyon], created by [Mark Otto][markdotto], and I like the clean simplicity very much.
For me the design evokes some of the typographical style of Edward Tufte or [Mike Bostock][mbostock] which provides some fertile ground for experimentation if I ever return to graphic design.

For now, the blog sits like an empty suit that needs some content to dress up.
